# Modifying Plots

Again as you know or suspect, most Java OceanAtlas plots can be extensively modified.

To change the scale range or other aspects of almost any Java OceanAtlas plot, double-click anywhere inside the content area. You will get a dialog box from which you can alter the scale range and make other changes.

Are the dots too small on the property-property plots? You can increase the symbol size or change the symbol shape.

Do you wish a different background color? Single-clicking on a color swatch in a dialog box brings up a color picker, or you can change to 'white' or 'black' plot styles.

And so forth.

The plot will be redrawn in accord with the new set-up information when 'OK' is clicked, or will update in the background if 'Apply' is clicked.

To avoid a Java problem with live resizing of JOA Map plots, it is usually necessary to click on the 'Refresh' button on the plot after resizing the plot window.
