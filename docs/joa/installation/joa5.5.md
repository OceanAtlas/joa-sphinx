## Windows
JOA 5.5 was tested on Windows 10 (1903). The installer .msi file should run on basically every recent-ish Windows OS, both 32 and 64-bit versions: Vista, Server, 7, 8, 8.1, and 10. Java 8 (the embedded JRE) is compatible with all of those except Vista and some old versions of Server. JOA has not been tested on Windows 11.
